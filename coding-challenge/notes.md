1) I had to take some time during the first requirement to think about how to deal with the XSS attack in Philip Brown's phone number. In a real project, any incoming data would need to be checked and sanitized before being saved in a production database. But in this situation, since a script has already been added to the database/json, I needed a way to deal with the output. Ideally, I would have liked to use regex to verify and reformat the phone numbers. However, since the phone numbers all look so different, I wasn't sure which country's phone number format would be the most appropriate to use. So, in the end, I elected to keep things simple for now and "sanitize" the phone numbers by replacing any and all script tags.
